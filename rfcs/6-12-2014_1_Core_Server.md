Core Server
=====

Explanation
-----------

The Core Server is the most fundamental building block of the **C Server**.
It acts as the connector between requests and the way they are handled.
Thus it is meant to be built waiting-free and multi-threaded.

C Server is meant to be running behind a reverse proxy, making it similar to
other web servers. This limitation also comes with less responsibilities, easing
the implementation as far less details need to be considered.

### 1. The Core Server

The Core Server itself manages incoming requests through a tcp socket. It then
uses its loaded modules to respond to the request. It does so by looking up its
own list of loaded modules. Each module has to be registered on load. This data
is then used to process the request. Modules are covered in their own section.
